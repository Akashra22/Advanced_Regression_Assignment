## General Information
The company planning to enter the House sales market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.


## Conclusions
- On analysing data, it was observed that, the linear regression model by using ridge and lasso regression, was able to predict based on what factor house price can be determined,
